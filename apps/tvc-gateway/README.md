# tvc-gateway

Helius-hosted backend for the Zolana private embedded wallet. It gives any
Helius customer the private-wallet backend with only an API key, at
`/v1/private-wallet/*` behind gatekeeper or directly. It fronts:

- the Zolana TVC enclave (`apps/privacy-wallet`),
- Turnkey (Boot Proofs and wallet ownership),

and holds the provisioning key that signs wallet descriptors. The Zolana
indexer and prover are gatekeeper's own `/v1/zolana/*` routes.

Devnet only: the enclave accepts `development` descriptors only.

## Request flow

```
client (browser, mobile or server, Helius API key)
  → helius-router → gatekeeper   (API key, domain ACL, rate limit, billing)
  → tvc-gateway                  (Authorization: gatekeeper origin secret,
                                  X-Helius-Project-Id: caller's project)
  → enclave / Turnkey

client (Helius API key as ?api-key= or X-Api-Key)
  → tvc-gateway                  (project from Helius dev-api's GET /waas/config)
  → enclave / Turnkey
```

A request with an `Authorization` header must carry gatekeeper's origin
value, and only then is `X-Helius-Project-Id` trusted. Any other request needs
a Helius API key, which the gateway resolves to its project through Helius
dev-api (`ts-services/dev-api` in helius-labs/monorepo) at `dev_api.base_url`,
and caches for `dev_api.project_cache_secs`. dev-api serves only projects with
the WaaS add-on: an unknown key is `401 ApiKeyInvalid`, a project without WaaS
`403 WaasNotEnabled`, and both refusals are cached for 30 seconds. A direct request is not metered and gets none of
gatekeeper's per-key limits.

## Endpoints

All paths are under `/v1/private-wallet`, and all take the caller's project
from gatekeeper or from the caller's API key.

| Method | Path          | Body                                        | Answer                     |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| POST   | `/session`    | the enclave's ping request                  | `{info, ping, bootProof}`  |
| POST   | `/enroll`     | an owner-signed enrollment                  | `{descriptor}`             |
| POST   | `/operations` | `{descriptor, request}`                     | `{response, bootProof}`    |

`GET /health` needs no credentials. [`openapi.json`](openapi.json) is the
OpenAPI 3.1 document of the API as gatekeeper serves it. A test fails when it
is stale; `BLESS_OPENAPI=1 cargo test` rewrites it.

Failures are RFC 9457 problems, `application/problem+json`:
`{"title", "status", "detail", "code"}`, where `code` is one of the codes the
OpenAPI document lists. `429` and `409 OperationInProgress` carry
`Retry-After`. A non-success enclave answer is passed through. Once a request
has reached the enclave or Turnkey, failures are `424`, never `5xx`, because
gatekeeper re-sends 5xx responses.

### Session

The body is the enclave's `POST /v1/ping` request: a challenge encrypted to the
release's quorum key. The gateway sends it to the enclave with `GET /v1/info`,
and answers with both enclave answers and the Turnkey Boot Proof of the replica
that signed the ping. The client verifies all three; the gateway vouches for
none of them.

### Enrollment

The wallet owner signs, with the wallet's Ed25519 key through Turnkey, a
[Sign-In With Solana](https://github.com/phantom/sign-in-with-solana) message:

```
beta-devnet.helius-rpc.com wants you to sign in with your Solana account:
<solanaAddress>

Authorize this device key to use your private wallet.

Version: 1
Chain ID: devnet
Issued At: <issuedAtMs as RFC 3339>
Expiration Time: <five minutes later>
Resources:
- urn:turnkey:organization:<organizationId>
- urn:turnkey:wallet:<turnkeyWalletId>
- urn:zolana-tvc:client-key:<clientPublicKey>
```

The first line names `enrollment.domain`, so a signature enrolls at one
gateway only. `walletEnrollmentMessage` in `@zolana/tvc-wallet/protocol`
builds the message. `fixtures/wallet-enrollment.json`, from
`createSignInMessageText` in `@solana/wallet-standard-util`, is its test
vector.

`POST /enroll` with
`{organizationId, turnkeyWalletId, solanaAddress, clientPublicKey, issuedAtMs, ownerSignature}`.
The gateway checks:

- that `issuedAtMs` is at most 5 minutes old and at most 30 s ahead;
- the signature;
- that the Turnkey sub-org is named after the caller's project;
- that the wallet account has the claimed address.

It answers `{descriptor}`, signed with the provisioning key for that one client
key. Enrolling again answers the same descriptor.

### Operations

`request` is the enclave's `EncryptedRequest` without `wallet_grant`. The
gateway checks:

- that it signed the descriptor, and that its client key is not revoked;
- that no request sent the ciphertext before;
- that the descriptor's Turnkey sub-org is named after the caller's project.

It then adds a wallet grant, the protocol's `WalletGrant`
(`crates/protocol/README.md`), signed with the grant key for this descriptor
and project and valid for `wallet_grant.ttl_secs`. The enclave checks the grant
names the request's descriptor and client key. The answer is the enclave's
`EncryptedResponse` and the Boot Proof of the replica that answered.

A resent ciphertext does not run twice. From the same project within
`enclave.replay_window_secs`, it gets the first request's answer again,
marked `Idempotent-Replayed: true`, or `409 OperationInProgress` while the
first is still running. From another project it gets `409 ReplayedRequest`.
A request that never reached the enclave, refused by the ownership check for
example, can be resent.

To revoke a client key, add its `tvc-browser-p256-…` ID to
`wallet_grant.revoked_client_key_ids`. The gateway refuses its enrollments and
operations from the next deploy.

### Limits

- **In-flight enclave calls:** at most `enclave.max_in_flight_per_project` per project (`429`).
- **Turnkey calls:** at most 32 at once across all projects (`429`); both Turnkey keys are shared.
- **Resends:** the replay ledger keys each `/operations` ciphertext by its digest, however its JSON is encoded. With `enclave.replay_redis_url` set, every task shares it through Redis, claiming with one `SET key running NX GET EX`, and it survives restarts; an unreachable Redis refuses the request with `424`. Without it, each process keeps its own.
- **Body size:** `enclave.max_body_bytes`.

## Configuration

`configs/config.yaml` holds the non-secret values. Secrets come from `TVC_GATEWAY_*`
environment variables, with nested fields joined by `__`:

| Variable                                                          | Value                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_ORIGIN_AUTH_HEADER`                                  | The `Authorization` value gatekeeper sends, 32 bytes or more. Always required.            |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_PROVISIONING__PRIVATE_KEY`                           | Provisioning P-256 secret, hex. Must match `provisioning.expected_public_key`.            |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_WALLET_GRANT__PRIVATE_KEY`                           | Wallet-grant P-256 secret, hex. Must match `wallet_grant.expected_public_key`.            |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_ENCLAVE__REPLAY_REDIS_URL`                           | Optional. Redis for the shared replay guard, such as `rediss://host:6379/2`.              |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_TURNKEY__BOOT_PROOF_API_KEY__{PUBLIC,PRIVATE}_KEY`   | Turnkey API key in the TVC organization that can read Boot Proofs.                        |
| `TVC_GATEWAY_TURNKEY__WAAS_API_KEY__{PUBLIC,PRIVATE}_KEY`         | Turnkey API key in the Helius WaaS parent organization, with read access to its sub-orgs. |

`enrollment.domain` is the host clients reach the gateway at, which enrollment
messages name. `dev_api.base_url` is the Helius dev-api that resolves a direct
caller's API key.

`configs/release-policy.json` and `configs/release-authorities.json` hold the
signed release policy that descriptors are issued under, and the authority set
it must verify against. The service refuses to start if the policy does not
verify.

**When a new enclave release ships:** `scripts/release.mjs pins` rewrites both
files; publish a new image and redeploy.

## Development

The crate is outside the root workspace, like `crates/boot-proof`, so the
Turnkey client and server graph stay out of the enclave build. `just fmt`,
`just lint` and `just test` cover it. Directly:

```sh
cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/tvc-gateway/Cargo.toml --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path apps/tvc-gateway/Cargo.toml --all-targets --locked
```

To run it, from `apps/tvc-gateway`:

```sh
TVC_GATEWAY_...=... cargo run -- configs/config.yaml
```

### Local end to end

```sh
just gateway-e2e
```

Runs `e2e/`, a vitest suite, on loopback. Its global setup (`e2e/stack.ts`)
starts:

- the local unattested testkit enclave (`zolana-tvc-privacy-wallet-local`), with fixed test keys and mock custody;
- a mock Turnkey answering the ownership and Boot Proof queries (`e2e/mock-turnkey.ts`);
- the gateway, with a release policy from `cargo run --example local_release_policy`.

The tests send the headers gatekeeper would add and drive a wallet through
the testkit client in gateway mode: enrollment, one session, Bootstrap,
TransactionKeys and a resend answered with the first answer, and the refusals
of stale, forged, other-domain and other-project enrollments, other projects'
wallets and resends, and descriptors this gateway did not provision. CI runs it after `just ci`. Service logs go to a temporary
directory the run prints.

`fixtures/wallet-enrollment.json` is the enrollment message test vector that
both this crate and `walletEnrollmentMessage` in `@zolana/tvc-wallet` check.

## Deployment

The service runs on AWS as one ECS Fargate task in the zolnet devnet stack
(`helius-labs/zolana-infra`, `infra/modules/zolnet/ecs_tvc_gateway.tf`), behind
that stack's ALB and a CloudFront distribution of its own.

1. Run the `publish-tvc-gateway-image` workflow. It pushes to the zolnet ECR
   repository `zolnet-tvc-gateway`, and its summary prints the `tvc_gateway_image`
   digest reference.
2. Pin that reference in the zolana-infra env's `terraform.tfvars` with
   `enable_tvc_gateway = true`, then deploy the env.
3. Populate the `zolnet-<env>/tvc-gateway` secret, as described in zolana-infra's
   `infra/README.md`.

The container needs `TVC_GATEWAY_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8940`, since the shipped config
listens on loopback, and `TVC_GATEWAY_STAGE=prod` for JSON logs. The zolana-infra
task definition sets both. The enclave timeout is 55s, under CloudFront's 60s
origin read timeout.
