# TypeScript client with a TVC wallet

A client example for `@heliuslabs/zolana` with the shielded keys held by a TVC
enclave (`@zolana/tvc-wallet`), in the layout of
[zolana-examples](https://github.com/helius-labs/zolana-examples).

- **[deposit_transfer_withdraw](examples/deposit_transfer_withdraw.ts)** - Deposit, private transfer, and withdraw, with the enclave as the key holder
- **[spl_deposit_transfer_withdraw](examples/spl_deposit_transfer_withdraw.ts)** - The same lifecycle for an SPL token registered with the pool
- **[ring_deposit_transfer_exit](examples/ring_deposit_transfer_exit.ts)** - Deposit into a custom ring, transfer inside it, and exit back to the default ring

## What a TVC wallet is

In the plain client, the application holds the shielded keys of a private
wallet. In a TVC wallet, an attested enclave (Turnkey Verifiable Compute on
AWS Nitro) holds them and answers the SDK's `WalletKeys` with them. The
application still runs the Zolana SDK for everything else, and every Solana
transaction is signed by the Turnkey wallet that owns the identity: in a
browser by the signed-in session, here by a Turnkey API key. This is for
applications with Turnkey embedded wallets that want private balances without
keeping shielded keys in a browser or on a server. The
[repository README](../../README.md) describes the split and the five enclave
operations.

## How the example works

1. `setup()` verifies the enclave against the client's release policy and PCR
   pins, configures the Turnkey grant, and returns the client, verified connection,
   and wallet signer.
2. `bootstrap` runs once per wallet. Its result, the public identity and the
   sealed seed, is stored in a file. Neither is a secret to the client. If the
   file is lost, `bootstrap` runs again and returns the same identity. Both
   initial setup and recovery automatically approve the exact bootstrap request
   through the configured owner session, within the same `bootstrap()` call.
3. `new TvcKeys({ client, connection, sealedSeed, identity })` is the SDK's
   `WalletKeys`, answered by the enclave.
4. The SDK does the rest: `Wallet`, `syncWallet`, `buildDepositTransaction`,
   `buildTransferTransaction`, `buildWithdrawalTransaction`. The calls are the
   same as with local keys.
5. The application signs each transaction with the Turnkey wallet, sends it,
   confirms it and syncs the wallet to the landed slot.

The plain client does the same with `LocalKeys.fromKeypair(keypair,
client.proofService)` in place of `TvcKeys`. Nothing else changes.

## What you need

- Node.js 24+, pnpm, and a Helius devnet API key.
- The TVC deployment's endpoint and trust material: the operator's
  `privacy-wallet.trust.json` (`releasePolicy`, `releaseAuthorities`,
  `qosIdentityPcrs`; `apps/privacy-wallet/deploy/` holds the current one).
  Never copy these values from the service itself.
- A Boot Proof source. Only a user of the TVC organization can read the
  enclave's Boot Proof from Turnkey, so either a server the operator runs
  returns it (`TVC_BOOT_PROOF_URL`; the wallet-kit demo serves
  `POST /api/tvc/boot-proof`, and
  [`zolana-tvc-boot-proof`](../../crates/boot-proof/README.md) is the same
  fetch as a command), or your Turnkey API key is a user of that organization
  and reads it directly (`TVC_ORGANIZATION_ID`).
- A Turnkey organization and a root user's API key, as the key pair or a
  Turnkey API key file (`TURNKEY_API_KEY_PATH`). The example signs with it,
  and `setup()` uses it to configure the enclave's grant. A browser integration
  uses the authenticated owner session and application provisioning backend;
  never embed a root API key in browser code or in the TVC deployment.
- A wallet descriptor for your client key, signed by the operator. See
  [Operator provisioning](#operator-provisioning) if one has not been issued.

## Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:ts
cd examples/typescript-client
cp client.env.example .env # ...and fill in the values
```

## Run

With the deployment and wallet configuration in `.env`, run one command. No
separate enrollment or approval command is needed:

```bash
pnpm example examples/deposit_transfer_withdraw.ts
```

The examples check balance changes relative to the wallet's starting balance,
so they can be rerun with an existing wallet.

The wallet in the descriptor pays fees and the deposit, so it needs devnet
SOL: the SOL and ring examples each deposit 0.01 SOL, so 0.1 SOL covers a
run of everything. For the SPL example set `SPL_MINT`, `SPL_ASSET_ID` (the id the pool
registered the mint under) and `SPL_TOKEN_ACCOUNT` (the wallet's token account
the deposit leaves from), and optionally `SPL_AMOUNT`:

```bash
pnpm example examples/spl_deposit_transfer_withdraw.ts
```

The ring example needs `RING_PROGRAM_ID`, a custom ring program registered
with the pool on the network you run against. Zolana v1 transactions do not use
address lookup tables. The TVC enclave completes the shielded-pool proof; the
client prover completes the ring's base and, when configured, policy proof, so
`ZOLANA_PROVER_URL` must list the matching custom-ring circuits at `GET /health`.
The ring program must accept those proofs; registration alone does not guarantee
compatibility:

```bash
pnpm example examples/ring_deposit_transfer_exit.ts
```

## Bootstrap authorization

The client returned by `setup()` keeps the normal `tvc.bootstrap(connection)`
interface. While that call is active, it finds a new pending Turnkey activity,
checks the exact SDK derivation message, wallet, organization, pinned service
signing key, and freshness, then approves the checked fingerprint using the
owner session. Previous pending activities and unrelated messages are skipped;
multiple matching activities fail rather than choosing one arbitrarily. The
watcher stops when bootstrap finishes, fails, is cancelled, or reaches its
65-second deadline. The enclave briefly retries permission denials while new
grants propagate, then polls the original activity. Run one bootstrap per
wallet at a time. Stored wallets
reuse their sealed seed and need no further approval polling.

The policy still requires **both** the owner and the service user. Automation
runs in the owner client; it does not give the service the owner's credential.
Turnkey [policy parameters](https://docs.turnkey.com/features/policies/language#activity-parameters)
cannot inspect the payload, so that exact-message check remains essential.
`setup()` reconciles the example's existing policies, including legacy grants
that allowed the service to sign alone, before returning a usable client.
Separately created signing grants must also be reviewed by the operator.

The owner approval API can return the bootstrap signature. The adapter discards
the result and does not log it; it must run in a trusted owner environment.
This restriction does not protect privacy secrets after a quorum-key compromise
or undo previous exposure. Live checks on 2026-09-09 against
`keyholder-pr9-34b4e28` verified attestation, encrypted ping, bootstrap with
automatic owner approval and App Proof verification, and recovery of the same
wallet identity. SOL and SPL deposit, private transfer, and withdrawal, plus
custom-ring deposit, transfer, and exit, all finalized on devnet with the expected
balance changes. The ring test used
`3H426EKpn3hhu3ra2rMfsVRs4HYbY3BqivadcJqFqAKg` with the default prover. An older
registered ring rejected its proofs with `ProofVerificationFailed`.

## Operator provisioning

A signed wallet descriptor and pinned deployment trust material are application
configuration. The operator signs the descriptor with its provisioning key;
that key is not distributed to wallet clients. An application can deliver the
descriptor during onboarding through its provisioning backend. This repository
provides an offline operator tool, not a hosted provisioning API.

If you are setting up a new development wallet, the optional helper prepares
the client key and wallet and prints the descriptor request:

```bash
pnpm example examples/enroll.ts
```

Set `TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID` and optionally `TURNKEY_WALLET_ADDRESS` for this
helper; without an address it creates a wallet and prints the address to retain.
The operator signs from the repository root:

```bash
node scripts/provision-descriptor.mjs --organization-id <org> --wallet-id <id> \
  --address <address> --client-public-key <hex> --out descriptor.json
```

Save the public descriptor at `TVC_DESCRIPTOR_PATH`. With an existing descriptor,
normal example runs configure permissions themselves; the helper is unnecessary.
Client key files are preserved on parse or read errors.

The enclave also refuses any operation without a current wallet grant. The
example signs its own, for 15 minutes each, with the operator's wallet-grant key
at `TVC_WALLET_GRANT_KEY_PATH` (`{"private_key": "<hex>"}`), whose public half is
`GRANT_PUBLIC` in `apps/privacy-wallet/src/operations/mod.rs`.

## Run locally

The examples run against the local testkit and a fresh Zolana localnet, with
a disposable keypair as the wallet in place of Turnkey and pinned process keys
in place of Nitro attestation. The Rust testkit runs the real handlers of the
five operations; the `@zolana/tvc-wallet/testing` client still verifies
envelopes, signatures and bindings, and accepts loopback HTTP only. It needs a
sibling `../zolana` checkout at the commit
[`headless-local-e2e.yml`](../../.github/workflows/headless-local-e2e.yml)
pins, with its localnet toolchain (Solana CLI, Go, Rust, `just`). From the
repository root:

```bash
just headless-e2e        # port offset 200
just headless-e2e 400
```

The recipe builds the package, starts the validator, Photon and the prover
(`scripts/start-localnet.sh`, which also mints a test SPL asset and initializes
a custom ring), starts the testkit, funds the keypair, runs the three examples,
and tears everything down. The same workflow runs it in CI. Setting
`TVC_LOCAL_TESTKIT_ENDPOINT` (with
`TVC_SOLANA_KEYPAIR_PATH`, `TVC_WALLET_PATH`, the `ZOLANA_*` URLs, the
`SPL_*` values and `RING_PROGRAM_ID`) runs an example against a stack you
started yourself.

## Persistence

The example syncs the wallet from the index on every run. An application that
reopens a wallet often can store the SDK wallet snapshot instead. The enclave
provides the snapshot key, so no secret is kept on the device:

```ts
import { loadPersistedWallet, syncPersistedWallet } from "@heliuslabs/zolana";
import { snapshotCipher } from "@zolana/tvc-wallet";

const cipher = await snapshotCipher(keys);
const wallet =
  (await loadPersistedWallet({ store, cipher })) ?? new Wallet({ identity });
await syncPersistedWallet({ client, wallet, keys, store, cipher });
```

`store` is any `{ load, save }` pair over a string, for example a file or
IndexedDB.

## Notes

- Pre-production, devnet only, disposable funds. The prover receives a
  plaintext witness that contains the nullifier secret.
- Never commit `.env`, the client key, the descriptor, or the stored wallet.
