/**
 * The HTTP port this client depends on.
 *
 * It lives with its consumer rather than in `platform/`, which holds adapters
 * that sit *above* the client (browser storage, the wallet facades). Keeping
 * the port here is what stops the dependency edge from pointing both ways.
 *
 * The default is plain `fetch` with no platform-specific behaviour; supply your
 * own to add retries, tracing, or a pinned agent.
