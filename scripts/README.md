# Operator tooling

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`release.mjs`](release.mjs) | Builds, deploys, and signs a release of the privacy-wallet enclave, then pins it in the wallet-kit demo. |
| [`provision-descriptor.mjs`](provision-descriptor.mjs) | Signs a wallet descriptor for one client key. |
| [`start-localnet.sh`](start-localnet.sh) | Starts a Zolana localnet for `just headless-e2e`. |

The scripts need Node 24, Docker with `linux/amd64`, cargo, and the Turnkey
`tvc` CLI logged in for the operators. Nothing here holds a key longer than
one call. Never commit Turnkey operator files, API keys, or `.env.local`.

## Release

Each deployment has its own Turnkey TVC app, Quorum key, `linux/amd64` image
pinned by `@sha256:`, signed release policy, and wallet descriptors. The
constants of the current app are in
[`apps/privacy-wallet/deploy/release.json`](../apps/privacy-wallet/deploy/release.json).

```sh
just release keyholder-v35                      # all four phases
node scripts/release.mjs policy keyholder-v35   # one phase
```

| Phase | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `build` | Builds and pushes the image and records `privacy-wallet-<release>.deployment.json` with the OCI digest and the `/tvc_app` SHA-256 (`expectedPivotDigest`). Debug mode stays off; `qosVersion` equals the pinned `qos_core`. |
| `deploy` | Drives the `tvc` CLI: creates the deployment, collects one approval per operator, provisions it, sets it live, and waits until `/v1/info` serves the release. Each approval shows the QOS manifest for the operator to confirm; `--unattended` skips that review. A re-run continues from the last completed step. |
| `policy` | Assembles the release policy from `/v1/info` and `release.json`, signs it with a one-time authority key (`cargo run -p zolana-tvc-protocol --example sign-release-policy`; the private half exists only inside that call), and writes `privacy-wallet.trust.json`: the policy, the authority public keys, and the QOS identity PCRs a client pins. |
| `pins` | Writes the trust material into the wallet-kit demo's `tvc-policy.ts` and enables its signature test. |

Turnkey keeps three deployable deployments per app. `--prune-deployments`
deletes the oldest that are neither live nor the release's own until the new
one fits, through the Turnkey API with the operator API key `tvc login` stored
(or `TVC_API_KEY_PUBLIC` / `TVC_API_KEY_PRIVATE`; `--api-key <org>` picks one
of several logins).

The [protocol specification](../crates/protocol/README.md#release-policy)
defines the policy and its signature. Re-signing means a new authority set
every client must accept.

## Wallet descriptors

A wallet descriptor is the operator's grant that lets one client key drive the
enclave operations of one Turnkey wallet. The client reports the values
(`examples/typescript-client` prints them from `pnpm example examples/enroll.ts`;
the wallet-kit demo requests a descriptor from its own route), and the
operator signs:

```sh
node scripts/provision-descriptor.mjs --organization-id <org> --wallet-id <id> \
  --address <address> --client-public-key <hex> --out descriptor.json
```

The security domain, environment, and operation list come from the published
trust material (`--trust`, default
`apps/privacy-wallet/deploy/privacy-wallet.trust.json`), so the descriptor
names exactly the release the client pins. The provisioning key comes from
`TVC_PROVISIONING_KEY_JSON` or `--provisioning-key <path>`, in the Turnkey API
key file format, and is checked against the public half compiled into the
image before it signs. Treat it as release material. The descriptor itself is
public data; the client stores it at its `TVC_DESCRIPTOR_PATH`.

The script imports the protocol package, so run `pnpm build:ts` first.

## Localnet

`start-localnet.sh PORT_OFFSET SOLANA_KEYPAIR FIXTURE_DIR OUTPUT_ENV` builds
the programs, Photon, the prover, and the CLI from a sibling `../zolana`
checkout, starts a validator with the shielded pool, Photon, and the prover on
the offset ports, mints a test SPL asset, deploys and initializes a custom
ring, and writes the `SPL_*` and `RING_PROGRAM_ID` values the client example
reads to `OUTPUT_ENV`. `just headless-e2e` runs it. The sibling checkout must
be at the zolana commit
[`headless-local-e2e.yml`](../.github/workflows/headless-local-e2e.yml) pins,
the same commit the packages' `@heliuslabs/zolana` dependency points at.
